## Notes to Accounts

1.	Assets Under Management (before fees)

AUM before fees = Total Assets – Total Liabilities

Assets Under Management (before fees) is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between all the assets the fund manages and all the liabilities the fund is obligated to pay/clear.

2.	Assets Under Management (previous phase)

Assets Under Management of the previous phase will be ascertained by bringing forward the Assets Under Management ascertained at the end of the previous phase.

3.	Capital Appreciation

Capital Appreciation = Assets Under Management (before fees) - Assets Under Management (at the beginning of the phase)

Capital appreciation is determined by arriving at the difference between the Assets Under Management (before fees) of the current phase and the Assets Under Management of the previous phase.

4.	Fees for the Phase

Fees are chargeable on two components: AUM (before fees) and Capital Appreciation.

a.	Management fees: Chargeable at 0.2% per phase on Assets Under Management (before fees).
b.	Performance fees: Chargeable at 20% per phase on Capital Appreciation.

5.	Assets Under Management

Assets Under Management is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between Assets Under Management (before fees) and the Fees for the Phase.

AUM = (1) – (4)

6.	Circulating Units

Circulating Units refers to total fund units (Radical Units / RDCL) outstanding, less units issued to the custodian/s. To ascertain Circulating Units, you can divide the total outstanding units issued by 2, as the Custodian/s hold 50% of total outstanding units at any given time.

7.	NAVPS

NAVPS or Net Asset Value Per Share is arrived at by dividing Assets Under Management with Circulating Units.

NAV = (5) / (6)

Note: For Phase 0 (June 2020) the fund was initiated with a NAVPS of $1 USD.

8.	Net Capital Appreciation

Net Capital Appreciation is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between Capital Appreciation and Fees for the Phase.

Net Capital Appreciation = (3) – (4)

9.	Net Capital Appreciation per Unit

Net Capital Appreciation per Unit is arrived at by dividing Net Capital Appreciation by Circulating Units.

Net Capital Appreciation per Unit = (8) / (6)
