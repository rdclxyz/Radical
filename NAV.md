## Notes to Accounts

#### 1.	Assets Under Management (before fees)

```
AUM before fees = Total Assets – Total Liabilities
```

Assets Under Management (before fees) is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between all the assets the fund manages and all the liabilities the fund is obligated to pay/clear.

#### 2.	Assets Under Management (previous phase)

Assets Under Management of the previous phase will be ascertained by bringing forward the Assets Under Management ascertained at the end of the previous phase.

#### 3.	Capital Appreciation

```
Capital Appreciation = Assets Under Management (before fees) - Assets Under Management (at the beginning of the phase)
```

Capital appreciation is determined by arriving at the difference between the Assets Under Management (before fees) of the current phase and the Assets Under Management of the previous phase.

#### 4.	Fees for the Phase

Fees are chargeable on two components: AUM (before fees) and Capital Appreciation.

a.	Management fees: Chargeable at `0.2%` per phase on Assets Under Management (before fees).
b.	Performance fees: Chargeable at `20%` per phase on Capital Appreciation.

#### 5.	Assets Under Management

Assets Under Management is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between Assets Under Management (before fees) and the Fees for the Phase.

```
AUM = (1) – (4)
```

#### 6.	Circulating Units

Circulating Units refers to total fund units (Radical Units / RDCL) outstanding, less units issued to the custodian/s. To ascertain Circulating Units, you can divide the total outstanding units issued by 2, as the Custodian/s hold 50% of total outstanding units at any given time.

#### 7.	NAVPS

NAVPS or Net Asset Value Per Share is arrived at by dividing Assets Under Management with Circulating Units.

```
NAV = (5) / (6)
```

Note: For Phase 0 (June 2020) the fund was initiated with a NAVPS of $1 USD.

#### 8.	Net Capital Appreciation

Net Capital Appreciation is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between Capital Appreciation and Fees for the Phase.

```
Net Capital Appreciation = (3) – (4)
```

#### 9.	Net Capital Appreciation per Unit

Net Capital Appreciation per Unit is arrived at by dividing Net Capital Appreciation by Circulating Units.

```
Net Capital Appreciation per Unit = (8) / (6)
```
