## Notes to Accounts

#### 1.	Assets Under Management (before fees)
```

Assets Under Management (before fees) is arrived at by ascertaining the difference between all the assets the fund manages and all the liabilities the fund is obligated to pay/clear.

#### 2.	Assets Under Management (at the beginning)

Assets Under Management of the previous phase will be ascertained by bringing forward the Assets Under Management ascertained at the end of the previous phase.

#### 3.	Deposits

#### 4.	Withdrawals

Withdrawals refers to the total capital (USDT 0r USDC) removed from the fund via the Deposit/Withdrawal address in the given phase. In the report, It is used to arrive at Capital Appreciation.

#### 5.	Capital Appreciation
```
Capital Appreciation = (1) – ((2) + (3) - (4))
```
Capital appreciation is determined by arriving at the difference between the Assets Under Management (before fees) of the current phase and the Assets Under Management of the previous phase.

#### 6.	Fees for the Phase

Fees are chargeable on two components: AUM (before fees) and Capital Appreciation.

a.	Management fees: Chargeable at `0.16%` per phase on Assets Under Management (before fees).

b.	Performance fees: Chargeable at `20%` per phase on Chargeable Capital Appreciation.

#### 7.	Assets Under Management

```

```
#### 8.	Circulating Units

Circulating Units refers to total fund units (Radical Units / RDCL) outstanding, less units issued to the custodian/s. To ascertain Circulating Units, you can divide the total outstanding units issued by 2, as the Custodian/s hold 50% of total outstanding units at any given time.

The total outstanding units of the fund consist of
-	Circulating Units – Issued to investors which can be used to redeem capital equivalent to the value of said units.
-	Custodian/s Units – Units issued to Custodian (Variable Labs). These units cannot be used to redeem capital.


#### 9.	NAVPS

NAVPS or Net Asset Value Per Share is arrived at by dividing Assets Under Management with Circulating Units.
```

```

#### 10.	High Water Mark (NAVPS)

High Water Mark (NAVPS) refers to the highest point the NAVPS has been accounted at over the history of the fund. This metric is used in the evaluation of performance fees.


#### 11.	High Water Mark (AUM)

```
